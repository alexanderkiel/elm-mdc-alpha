# Material Components for the Web for Elm

This is an yet unfinished variant of [aforemny/elm-mdc][1] without the central state handling. Documentation will follow.

## Usage

The aim of this package is to give you a light binding from Elm to Material Components for the Web. This package doesn't need any JavaScript and asks you import the required CSS classes yourself. Doing so you have pure Elm code and have full power over how you import the required CSS classes. The documentation will show you how to import CSS using npm and Sass.

## Install

You can find this package on [elm packages][2]. Install it via:

```bash
elm install alexanderkiel/elm-mdc-alpha
```

## Build

Install `elm` and `elm-test` with `npm` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g elm
npm install -g elm-test@beta
```

Run `elm-test`:

```bash
elm-test
```
